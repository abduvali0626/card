It is also known as the Red Planet, because of its orange-red appearance.[22][23] Mars is a desert-like rocky planet with a tenuous carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere. At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from −153 °C (−243 °F) to 20 °C (68 °F)[24] and cosmic radiation is high. Mars retains some water, in the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere, forming cirrus clouds, frost, larger polar regions of permafrost and ice caps (with seasonal CO2 snow), but no liquid surface water. Its surface gravity is roughly a third of Earth's or double that of the Moon. It is half as wide as Earth or twice the Moon, with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi), and has a surface area the size of all the dry land of Earth."

Registered users (commonly referred to as redditors) submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down (upvoted or downvoted) by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called subreddits. Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page. Reddit administrators moderate the communities. Moderation is also conducted by community-specific moderators, who are unpaid volunteers.[6] It is operated by Reddit Inc., based in San Francisco.[7][8]"

It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels[7]), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[8] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems."
